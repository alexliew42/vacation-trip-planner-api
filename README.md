# TravelCity

Describe your app here. (What is your 1 minute “elevator pitch” of your capstone project? What problem does it solve? What inspired you to build it?)
TravelCity is a vacation trip planner app that allows users to plan for trips and log vacations. 
It solves the organization aspect of creating a trip planner by hand because each trip has unique places.
I was inspired to build it because I am going on vacation soon and wanted to create an app that I could potentially use. 


Describe the technologies you used to build your app (Ruby on Rails backend, React.js frontend, any libraries, APIs, etc.)
* Ruby on Rails backend
* React.js frontend
* Pigeon maps
* Geocoder

Optional: Add screenshots or gifs of your application

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
npm run dev
```

You'll need to have the backend code (https://github.com/alexliew42/vacation-trip-planner-api) running on http://localhost:3000.
You can view the app on http://localhost:5173.

## Roadmap

List any ideas you plan on implementing in the future.
